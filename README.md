# Code-Refactor

As a way to prepare us for future employment, in this assignment I had to improve existing code for a marketing agency. The agency wanted a codebase that optimized their website. 

I improved their codebase so that it followed accessibility standards. The code now has:
  - semantic HTML elements, 
  - a logical elements structure,
  - images with accessible alt attributes, 
  - heading attributes that fall in sequential order and,
  - a concise, descriptive title.
